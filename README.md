# Book Library Manager ![Build-Status](https://travis-ci.org/sindresorhus/sindresorhus.svg?branch=master )

Book Library Manager is a project that helps you to create personal book libraries for various people. Also, since it was a project for college, a user can manage prerequisite course textbook/resources. Thus, the application assists program coordinators to keep track of resources required and used by professors during different semesters.


## Prerequisites

* You may need to install **Java 8.0** to be able to execute this program.
* You may need to create a **DBinformation.txt** file at the project directory, and put the correct database information in the File. Note that Book Library Manager only works with **Oracle SQL databases.**
* If you open the project in an IDE, make sure to add all the **libraries** in **lib** folder to your project.
